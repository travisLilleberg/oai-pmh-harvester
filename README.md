# oai-pmh-harvester
A basic OAI-PMH harvester that just saves the xml to disk.

Just change the $base_url variable in the script to whatever you need. The script 
handles resumption tokens automatically.

You can also set a maximum number of harvests in the script, if you want to test it out 
before you do a full harvest.
